# Imdad – Bridging Hunger with Humanity
</div>


## 📌 Project Overview

**Imdad** is a mobile application developed to bridge the gap between surplus food providers—like restaurants, event organizers, and individuals—and orphanages in need. The platform enables food donors to instantly notify partner orphanages about available surplus food, which they can accept or reject. Logistics are then coordinated for collection, ensuring that no edible food goes to waste while children sleep hungry.
